# Artho-ScanPro
ArthoScan Pro is a deep learning-powered web application designed to assist in the early detection and grading of knee osteoarthritis (OA) using X-ray images. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on grayscale knee radiographs to classify the severity of OA into five KL grades (0 to 4).
